# IN_Soundex
Soundex Algorithms currently used are not working with indian names, Therefore this project will concentrate on generate same soundex for the strings/texts that generates similar sound while pronounced.

Most of all other implementation of soundex find and remove vowels(a,e,i,o,u,s) in their first step. But what I thought is that these vowels or combination shape the sound of a letter, therefore we must tokanize them first and tried to did it in my inpmlementation.

All the letters or combination of letters(substrings) replaced or tokanized in this algorithm are with consideration of Indian Names only right now. So it will work with indian names in first place.
